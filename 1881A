# Explanation:
Note that the answer is always not greater than 5
. When n=1
, m=25
, the answer is either 5
 or −1
, it is easy to see that the answer cannot be greater.

This allows us to simply iterate over the number of operations, each time checking if s
 occurs in x
. The time complexity of this solution is O(25⋅n⋅m)
